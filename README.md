# Creating a Web Application for an ETF Analyzer

*Module 7 Challenge Assignment*

This is a Python application written with Pandas in Jupyter Lab. It uses the Pandas to build a financial database by using SQL and Python to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. We then use the Voil√† library to create and deploy a web application. HvPlot is used to create interactive graphs to examine the data.

## Technologies

The application is written using Pandas

The following packages are used:

Pandas - to write and run the program [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

hvPlot - to create graphs [hvPlot documentation](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/)

sqalchemy - to make SQL queries and read a database we use to make pandas dataframes - [sqalchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/)

NumPy - for mathematical functions [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)

Voila is used to deploy the web application - [Voila documentation](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
